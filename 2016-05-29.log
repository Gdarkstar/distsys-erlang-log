[11:24:39] <vinayb> hey guys
[11:25:22] <salman-bhai> hey
[11:25:43] <salman-bhai> vilas_m Me! :p
[11:26:21] <vilas_m> Hi ! :)
[11:27:06] <akshayrevankar> ██████╗ ███████╗ ██████╗██╗   ██╗██████╗ ███████╗██╗ ██████╗ ███╗   ██╗
[11:27:16] <vilas_m> Good timing for the session xD Would have switched off the TV anyway :P
[11:27:17] <akshayrevankar> Hey guys
[11:27:32] <salman-bhai> hey akshay
[11:27:49] <aditya> Hi!
[11:27:50] <vilas_m> Hi Akshay Sir :)
[11:28:38] <akshayrevankar> Thanks for being here on a Sunday :D.. Hope you dont mind a 1 hour session :P
[11:28:57] *** vinayb changes topic to 'Distributed Systems Programming with Erlang | Today's log: https://goo.gl/GFWbqP'
[11:30:01] <akshayrevankar> We will start the session after 5 minutes..
[11:30:18] <vinayb> call all your friends guys
[11:30:28] <akshayrevankar> So how are vacations going on for all?
[11:30:33] <vinayb> i expect everyone to be here
[11:30:57] <akshayrevankar> vinayb #being strict is it :P
[11:31:42] <vinayb> ;)
[11:35:58] <akshayrevankar> ok guys.. so we will start of with todays session..
[11:36:20] <akshayrevankar> so last time rakshith asked if there exists any looping constructs in erlang..
[11:36:24] *** Joins: adarsh_h (6ace890c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.106.206.137.12)
[11:36:35] <akshayrevankar> as vinay said, there are no looping constructs.. like for or while
[11:36:51] <akshayrevankar> so we make the use of recursion in implementing of loops..
[11:37:17] <akshayrevankar> so can someone recall and list what all you guys coded using recursion in your CO110 course
[11:38:16] <vilas_m> Factorial, binary search, sum upto n, nCr.
[11:38:45] <aditya> fibonacci,sumofdigits
[11:39:16] <vilas_m> X^n
[11:39:20] <akshayrevankar> yes.. you implemented the funtions as you mentioned using recursion.. you were explictly taught some functions using recursion..
[11:39:38] <akshayrevankar> but what are you actually doing there in reality.. can the same function be implemented using a while loop?
[11:40:11] <akshayrevankar> can one of you write down a C like code here for a while loop based factorial and a recursion based
[11:40:31] <akshayrevankar> aditya can write down the C like
[11:40:39] <akshayrevankar> and vilas the recursion based
[11:41:19] <akshayrevankar> I want others to also acknowledge and reply... dont be a spectator only.. If you dont know anything, ask of immediately..
[11:41:34] <aditya> fact=1; while(n){ fact*=n; n--;}
[11:41:55] <vilas_m> int fact (int n) { if(n==1) return 1; else return(n*fact(n-1)); }
[11:43:04] <akshayrevankar> ok.. can someone identify a small correction in code written by vilas..
[11:43:21] <aditya> o factorial!
[11:43:34] <akshayrevankar> correct aditya..
[11:43:47] <akshayrevankar> just a matter of n==0 instead of n==1
[11:44:07] <akshayrevankar> so this condition of n==0 is called the base case for recursion..
[11:44:19] <akshayrevankar> which is when the recursion stops..
[11:44:54] <akshayrevankar> today we will first start by writing a factorial code in erlang..
