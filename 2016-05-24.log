[09:08:52] <salman-bhai> Just in case anyone is interested.
[09:12:35] <vinayb> selections for this year's GSoC are over yeah?
[09:13:25] <salman-bhai> Yeah long back
[09:14:40] <salman-bhai> The projects have started today.
[09:14:54] <salman-bhai> Well they started coding today for the projects!
[09:15:45] <vinayb> oh interesting
[09:15:52] <vinayb> i should talk to Param 
[09:19:17] <salman-bhai> Do people get GSoC at the end of second year from NITK?
[09:20:34] <vinayb> some excellent people do. Karthik Senthil two years back. Param Hanji this year

[09:33:03] <salman-bhai> Hi everyone!
[09:34:04] <vilas_m> Hi Bhai! :P
[09:35:28] <aditya> Hi Sallu bhai!!
[09:36:00] <salman-bhai> @vinayb See I told u :D
[09:36:14] <vinayb> haha salman-bhai xD
[09:36:33] <vinayb> btw salman-bhai, can you please message your peers to join us here :P
[09:36:45] <salman-bhai> sure
[09:38:49] <vinayb> alright, we'll begin
[09:38:55] <salman-bhai> Pratyush will join us in 5 minutes
[09:39:03] <vinayb> All of you guys ready?
[09:39:10] <salman-bhai> yeah
[09:39:11] <vilas_m> Yea
[09:39:25] <aditya> yes!
[09:39:55] <vinayb> salman-bhai, if you can, msg the others too
[09:40:02] <vinayb> okay so today we'll start off with modules
[09:40:12] <vinayb> in the past session, we saw the erlang shell 
[09:40:19] <vinayb> and how to run our expressions on it
[09:40:38] <vinayb> But any sort of longform programming is not possible :P 
[09:40:45] <vinayb> so we need to write in files
[09:40:59] <vinayb> Modules are a bunch of functions regrouped in a single file, under a single name.
[09:41:27] <vinayb> Additionally, all functions in Erlang must be defined in modules
[09:41:44] <vinayb> You have already used modules, perhaps without realizing it
[09:41:51] <vinayb> hd() and tl()
[09:41:58] <vinayb> these belong to the erlang module
[09:42:14] <vinayb> as well as all of the arithmetic, logic and boolean operators
[09:42:21] *** Joins: adarsh_h (6ad881a9@gateway/web/freenode/ip.106.216.129.169)
[09:42:50] <vinayb> Functions from the "erlang" module are automatically imported when you use erlang
[09:43:14] <vinayb> Every other function defined in a module you will ever use needs to be called the form Module:Function(Arguments)
[09:43:21] <vinayb> if you open up your shell
[09:43:25] <vinayb> you can try this;
[09:43:29] <vinayb> *:
[09:43:38] <vinayb> erlang:element(2, {a,b,c}).
[09:43:48] <vinayb> element(2, {a,b,c}).
[09:44:03] <vinayb> they'll give the same result, as erlang module is always loaded in shell
[09:44:18] <salman-bhai> b
[09:44:44] <salman-bhai> Is the result/answer
[09:44:52] <vinayb> So let's talk about writing our own modules
[09:45:07] <vinayb> right salman-bhai !
[09:45:19] <salman-bhai> @vinayb
[09:45:26] <salman-bhai> What did we just do?
[09:45:35] <vinayb> When writing a module, you can declare two kinds of things: *functions* and *attributes*
[09:45:49] <vinayb> We called a function in the form Module:Function(Arguments)
[09:45:56] <salman-bhai> OKay ....
[09:46:02] <salman-bhai> Go on
[09:46:17] <vinayb> so, there's a module called "erlang" which has the function called element
[09:46:22] <vinayb> that's what we did
[09:46:55] <vinayb> alright guys, open a file and save it as erlang_module.erl
