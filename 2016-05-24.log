[09:08:52] <salman-bhai> Just in case anyone is interested.
[09:12:35] <vinayb> selections for this year's GSoC are over yeah?
[09:13:25] <salman-bhai> Yeah long back
[09:14:40] <salman-bhai> The projects have started today.
[09:14:54] <salman-bhai> Well they started coding today for the projects!
[09:15:45] <vinayb> oh interesting
[09:15:52] <vinayb> i should talk to Param 
[09:19:17] <salman-bhai> Do people get GSoC at the end of second year from NITK?

[09:33:03] <salman-bhai> Hi everyone!
[09:34:04] <vilas_m> Hi Bhai! :P
[09:35:28] <aditya> Hi Sallu bhai!!
[09:36:00] <salman-bhai> @vinayb See I told u :D
[09:36:14] <vinayb> haha salman-bhai xD
[09:36:33] <vinayb> btw salman-bhai, can you please message your peers to join us here :P
[09:36:45] <salman-bhai> sure
[09:38:49] <vinayb> alright, we'll begin
[09:38:55] <salman-bhai> Pratyush will join us in 5 minutes
[09:39:03] <vinayb> All of you guys ready?
[09:39:10] <salman-bhai> yeah
[09:39:11] <vilas_m> Yea
[09:39:25] <aditya> yes!
[09:39:55] <vinayb> salman-bhai, if you can, msg the others too
[09:40:02] <vinayb> okay so today we'll start off with modules
[09:40:12] <vinayb> in the past session, we saw the erlang shell 
[09:40:19] <vinayb> and how to run our expressions on it
[09:40:38] <vinayb> But any sort of longform programming is not possible :P 
[09:40:45] <vinayb> so we need to write in files
[09:40:59] <vinayb> Modules are a bunch of functions regrouped in a single file, under a single name.
[09:41:27] <vinayb> Additionally, all functions in Erlang must be defined in modules
[09:41:44] <vinayb> You have already used modules, perhaps without realizing it
[09:41:51] <vinayb> hd() and tl()
[09:41:58] <vinayb> these belong to the erlang module
[09:42:14] <vinayb> as well as all of the arithmetic, logic and boolean operators
