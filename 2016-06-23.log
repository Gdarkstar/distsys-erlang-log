[08:31:11] <vinayb> passing around state between processes, selectively receiving certain messages, time delays etc
[08:31:41] <vinayb> and i'll also show you some code that'll clarify your flush doubt
[08:31:48] <aditya_> ok!
[08:32:11] <vinayb> we'll wait a few minutes for others to join
[08:32:16] <vinayb> and then we'll start
[08:32:38] <aditya_> Fine!
[08:36:53] <vinayb> we'll start now
[08:38:37] <vinayb> so now we've seen how to pass around simple messages between processes
[08:38:45] *** Joins: rakshith (~hehaichi@103.194.12.98)
[08:39:53] <vinayb> let's see how we can maintain state in a process, or rather how to store values which persist between repeated invocations of the process
[08:40:22] <vinayb> let's first create a function in a new kitchen.erl module that will let a process act like a fridge :P
[08:40:32] <vinayb> Here are the requirements: 
[08:40:52] <vinayb> we should be able to store food in the fridge, and take out food from the fridge
[08:41:07] <vinayb> it should only be possible to take food that has been stored beforehand
[08:41:24] <vinayb> type up this in the new file:
[08:42:09] <vinayb> -module(kitchen).
[08:42:10] <vinayb> -compile(export_all).
[08:42:10] <vinayb> fridge1() ->
[08:42:10] <vinayb>     receive
[08:42:10] <vinayb>         {From, {store, _Food}} ->
[08:42:12] <vinayb>             From ! {self(), ok},
[08:42:14] <vinayb>             fridge1();
[08:42:17] <vinayb>         {From, {take, _Food}} ->
[08:42:19] <vinayb>             %% uh....
[08:42:22] <vinayb>             From ! {self(), not_found},
[08:42:25] <vinayb>             fridge1();
[08:42:27] <vinayb>         terminate ->
[08:42:30] <vinayb>             ok
[08:42:32] <vinayb>     end.
[08:43:12] <vinayb> can anyone notice any issue with this function?
[08:43:19] <vinayb> does it meet our requirements?
[08:45:34] <aditya_>  'take'  food doesnt make sense ? from where?
[08:46:09] <vinayb> exactly! we are not storing food anywhere. so it's kinda impossible to take it
[08:46:31] <vinayb> basically, we need to maintain state 
[08:46:38] <vinayb> so we can use recursion
[08:46:58] <vinayb> then, the state to a process can be held entirely in the parameters of the function 
[08:47:40] <vinayb> in the case of our fridge process, a possibility would be to store all the food as a list, and then look in that list when someone needs to eat something:
[08:47:43] <vinayb> so type this up:
[08:48:35] <vinayb> fridge2(FoodList) ->
[08:48:35] <vinayb>     receive
[08:48:35] <vinayb>         {From, {store, Food}} ->
[08:48:35] <vinayb>             From ! {self(), ok},
[08:48:35] <vinayb>             fridge2([Food|FoodList]);
[08:48:37] <vinayb>         {From, {take, Food}} ->
[08:48:40] <vinayb>             case lists:member(Food, FoodList) of
[08:48:42] <vinayb>                 true ->
[08:48:45] <vinayb>                     From ! {self(), {ok, Food}},
[08:48:47] <vinayb>                     fridge2(lists:delete(Food, FoodList));
[08:48:50] <vinayb>                 false ->
[08:48:52] <vinayb>                     From ! {self(), not_found},
[08:48:55] <vinayb>                     fridge2(FoodList)
[08:48:57] <vinayb>             end;
[08:49:00] <vinayb>         terminate ->
[08:49:02] <vinayb>             ok
[08:49:05] <vinayb>     end.
[08:50:08] <vinayb> now type this in the shell:
[08:50:08] <vinayb> c(kitchen).
[08:50:24] <vinayb> Pid = spawn(kitchen, fridge2, [[baking_soda]]).
[08:50:36] <vinayb> Pid ! {self(), {store, milk}}.
[08:50:42] <vinayb> flush().
[08:50:52] <vinayb> what's the output?
[08:52:04] <vinayb> Pid ! {self(), {store, chocolate}}.
[08:52:14] <vinayb> Pid ! {self(), {take, chocolate}}.
[08:52:27] <vinayb> Pid ! {self(), {take, bread}}.
[08:52:29] <vinayb> flush().
[08:52:36] <vinayb> what are the outputs for these too?
[08:53:39] <rakshith> Shell got {<0.61.0>,ok}
[08:53:40] <rakshith> Shell got {<0.61.0>,{ok,chocolate}}
[08:53:40] <rakshith> Shell got {<0.61.0>,not_found}
[08:53:40] <rakshith> ok
[08:55:17] <vinayb> right! so basically what we are doing in this process is that we are storing the entire list in the parameter, and appending to it whenever we have to "store" something. When we have to take out something, we check if it is there in the list or not, if it is, we remove it, if not, we return not_found
[08:55:22] <vinayb> any doubts?
[08:55:47] <aditya_> no
[08:55:51] <rakshith> no
[08:56:31] <vinayb> so tell how does storing in the parameter work? why is it not "vanishing" after we spawn the process and call it once/
[08:56:34] <vinayb> *?
[08:59:16] <vinayb> okay, it is because of recursion
[08:59:24] <vinayb> since we call the function again
[09:00:15] *** Joins: akshayrevankar (67157d53@gateway/web/freenode/ip.103.21.125.83)
[09:01:15] <vinayb> okay, now something annoying is that the person using the fridge needs to know the protocol that's been invented for that process. That's a burden, we can simplify things. Also, note that we had to call flush() to get all the received messages. Let's see how we can change that
[09:01:26] <vinayb> type this up:
[09:01:36] <vinayb> store(Pid, Food) ->
[09:01:37] <vinayb>     Pid ! {self(), {store, Food}},
[09:01:37] <vinayb>     receive
[09:01:37] <vinayb>         {Pid, Msg} -> Msg
[09:01:37] <vinayb>     end.
[09:01:39] <vinayb> take(Pid, Food) ->
[09:01:41] <vinayb>     Pid ! {self(), {take, Food}},
[09:01:44] <vinayb>     receive
[09:01:46] <vinayb>         {Pid, Msg} -> Msg
[09:01:49] <vinayb>     end.
[09:02:44] <vinayb> now the interaction with the process is much cleaner:
[09:02:48] <vinayb> c(kitchen).
[09:02:51] <vinayb> f().
[09:03:04] <vinayb> Pid = spawn(kitchen, fridge2, [[baking_soda]]).
[09:03:13] <vinayb> kitchen:store(Pid, water).
[09:03:20] <vinayb> kitchen:take(Pid, water).
[09:03:31] <vinayb> kitchen:take(Pid, juice).
[09:03:41] <vinayb> what's the output?
[09:04:33] <aditya_> ok {ok,water}  not_found
[09:05:15] <vinayb> right! aditya_ is your doubt cleared now? did you notice how by using receive..end expression in our helper functions we showed the msg without using flush()?
[09:05:49] <aditya_> yes!
[09:07:05] <vinayb> alright. now, the one thing left to do would be to hide that whole part about needing to spawn a process. so we can add the following start/1 function:
[09:07:22] <vinayb> start(FoodList) -> spawn(?MODULE, fridge2, [FoodList]).
[09:07:37] <vinayb> Here, ?MODULE is a macro returning the current module's name
[09:07:48] <vinayb> Erlang macros are just like C macros
[09:08:39] <vinayb> okay, so now everything to do with the fridge process is now handled in the kitchen module
[09:08:48] <vinayb> let's see this function put to use:
[09:08:51] <vinayb> f().
[09:08:54] <vinayb> c(kitchen).
[09:09:20] <vinayb> Pid = kitchen:start([dairy_milk, oreos, lays]).
[09:09:29] <vinayb> kitchen:take(Pid, oreos).
[09:09:38] <vinayb> kitchen:take(Pid, oreos).
[09:09:46] <vinayb> what's the output?
[09:10:15] <aditya_> <0.128.0>  {ok,oreos}  not_found
[09:11:18] <vinayb> right! now that the oreos are out of the fridge, our abstraction is complete
[09:12:25] <vinayb> alright, let's try a little something with the help of the command pid(A,B,C)
[09:12:41] <vinayb> this command lets us change the 3 integers A, B and C into a pid
[09:13:28] <vinayb> here we'll deliberately feed kitchen:take/2 a fake one:
[09:13:42] <vinayb> kitchen:take(pid(0,250,0), oreos).
[09:13:54] <vinayb> run this. what happens when you try this out?
[09:15:14] <aditya_> no output!
[09:15:26] <vinayb> yep, the shell freezes!
[09:15:46] <vinayb> to understand what's going on, let's revise what happens in the normal case when we call take/2
[09:15:53] <vinayb> 1. A message to take food is sent from you (the shell) to the fridge process;
[09:16:00] <vinayb> 2. Your process switches to receive mode and waits for a new message;
[09:16:08] <vinayb> 3. The fridge removes the item and sends it to your process;
[09:16:22] <vinayb> 4. Your process receives it and moves on with its life.
[09:16:33] <vinayb> And here's what happens when the shell freezes:
[09:16:39] <vinayb> 1. A message to take food is sent from you (the shell) to an unknown process;
[09:16:47] <vinayb> 2. Your process switches to receive mode and waits for a new message;
[09:16:54] <vinayb> 3. The unknown process either doesn't exist or doesn't expect such a message and does nothing with it;
[09:17:01] <vinayb> 4. Your shell process is stuck in receive mode.
[09:17:26] <vinayb> that's annoying, especially because there is no error handling possible here. Nothing illegal happened, the program is just waiting. 
[09:18:11] <vinayb> In general, anything dealing with asynchronous operations (which is how message passing is done in Erlang) needs a way to give up after a certain period of time if it gets no sign of receiving data
[09:19:04] <vinayb> A web browser does it when a page or image takes too long to load, you do it when someone takes too long before answering the phone or is late at a meeting.
[09:19:44] <vinayb> Erlang certainly has an appropriate mechanism for that, and it's part of the receive construct:
[09:19:59] <vinayb> receive Match -> Expression1
[09:19:59] <vinayb> after Delay -> Expression2
[09:20:00] <vinayb> end.
[09:20:32] <vinayb> The part in between receive and after is exactly the same that we already know. The after part will be triggered if as much time as Delay (an integer representing milliseconds) has been spent without receiving a message that matches the Match pattern. When this happens, Expression2 is executed.
[09:22:41] <vinayb> We'll write two new interface functions, store2/2 and take2/2, which will act exactly like store/2 and take/2 with the exception that they will stop waiting after 3 seconds:
[09:23:03] <aditya_> Is d match compulsory before d ' after Delay '?
[09:24:13] <vinayb> no, you can do this also:
[09:24:16] <vinayb> func() ->
[09:24:18] <vinayb>   receive
[09:24:22] <vinayb> after T -> ok
[09:24:26] <vinayb>   end.
[09:24:40] <vinayb> i'll show you an example of this type
[09:24:42] <vinayb> but before that
[09:24:52] <aditya_> ok
[09:24:55] <vinayb> let's see store and take
[09:25:00] <vinayb> store2(Pid, Food) ->
[09:25:00] <vinayb>     Pid ! {self(), {store, Food}},
[09:25:00] <vinayb>     receive
[09:25:00] <vinayb>         {Pid, Msg} -> Msg
[09:25:00] <vinayb>     after 3000 ->
[09:25:02] <vinayb>         timeout
[09:25:05] <vinayb>     end.
[09:25:07] <vinayb> take2(Pid, Food) ->
[09:25:10] <vinayb>     Pid ! {self(), {take, Food}},
[09:25:12] <vinayb>     receive
[09:25:15] <vinayb>         {Pid, Msg} -> Msg
[09:25:17] <vinayb>     after 3000 ->
[09:25:20] <vinayb>         timeout
[09:25:22] <vinayb>     end.
[09:26:32] <vinayb> you can now unfreeze the shell with Ctrl+G
[09:26:37] <vinayb> and try the new functions
[09:26:43] <vinayb> c(kitchen).
[09:26:57] <vinayb> kitchen:take2(pid(0,250,0), dog).
[09:27:02] <vinayb> what's the output?
[09:29:34] <aditya_> timeout
[09:29:43] <vinayb> right! so that's how it works
[09:30:11] <vinayb> the timer:sleep/1 function we used earlier is implemented this way:
[09:30:16] <vinayb> sleep(T) ->
[09:30:19] <vinayb>   receieve 
[09:30:22] <vinayb>   after T -> ok
[09:30:24] <vinayb>   end.
[09:30:40] <vinayb> In this specific case, no message will ever be matched in the receive part of the construct because there is no pattern. Instead, the after part of the construct will be called once the delay T has passed.
[09:31:39] <vinayb> Another special case is when the timeout is at 0:
[09:31:53] <vinayb> flush() ->
[09:31:54] <vinayb>     receive
[09:31:54] <vinayb>         _ -> flush()
[09:31:54] <vinayb>     after 0 ->
[09:31:54] <vinayb>         ok
[09:31:56] <vinayb>     end.
[09:32:39] <vinayb> When that happens, the Erlang VM will try and find a message that fits one of the available patterns. In the case above, anything matches. As long as there are messages, the flush/0 function will recursively call itself until the mailbox is empty. Once this is done, the after 0 -> ok part of the code is executed and the function returns.
[09:33:06] <vinayb> any doubts?
