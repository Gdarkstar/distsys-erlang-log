[08:30:41] <aditya_> Wat r u going to teach today?
[08:31:11] <vinayb> passing around state between processes, selectively receiving certain messages, time delays etc
[08:31:41] <vinayb> and i'll also show you some code that'll clarify your flush doubt
[08:31:48] <aditya_> ok!
[08:32:11] <vinayb> we'll wait a few minutes for others to join
[08:32:16] <vinayb> and then we'll start
[08:32:38] <aditya_> Fine!
[08:36:53] <vinayb> we'll start now
[08:38:37] <vinayb> so now we've seen how to pass around simple messages between processes
[08:38:45] *** Joins: rakshith (~hehaichi@103.194.12.98)
[08:39:53] <vinayb> let's see how we can maintain state in a process, or rather how to store values which persist between repeated invocations of the process
[08:40:22] <vinayb> let's first create a function in a new kitchen.erl module that will let a process act like a fridge :P
[08:40:32] <vinayb> Here are the requirements: 
[08:40:52] <vinayb> we should be able to store food in the fridge, and take out food from the fridge
[08:41:07] <vinayb> it should only be possible to take food that has been stored beforehand
[08:41:24] <vinayb> type up this in the new file:
[08:42:09] <vinayb> -module(kitchen).
[08:42:10] <vinayb> -compile(export_all).
[08:42:10] <vinayb> fridge1() ->
[08:42:10] <vinayb>     receive
[08:42:10] <vinayb>         {From, {store, _Food}} ->
[08:42:12] <vinayb>             From ! {self(), ok},
[08:42:14] <vinayb>             fridge1();
[08:42:17] <vinayb>         {From, {take, _Food}} ->
[08:42:19] <vinayb>             %% uh....
[08:42:22] <vinayb>             From ! {self(), not_found},
[08:42:25] <vinayb>             fridge1();
[08:42:27] <vinayb>         terminate ->
[08:42:30] <vinayb>             ok
[08:42:32] <vinayb>     end.
[08:43:12] <vinayb> can anyone notice any issue with this function?
[08:43:19] <vinayb> does it meet our requirements?
[08:45:34] <aditya_>  'take'  food doesnt make sense ? from where?
[08:46:09] <vinayb> exactly! we are not storing food anywhere. so it's kinda impossible to take it
