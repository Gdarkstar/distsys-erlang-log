[08:30:41] <aditya_> Wat r u going to teach today?
[08:31:11] <vinayb> passing around state between processes, selectively receiving certain messages, time delays etc
[08:31:41] <vinayb> and i'll also show you some code that'll clarify your flush doubt
[08:31:48] <aditya_> ok!
[08:32:11] <vinayb> we'll wait a few minutes for others to join
[08:32:16] <vinayb> and then we'll start
[08:32:38] <aditya_> Fine!
[08:36:53] <vinayb> we'll start now
[08:38:37] <vinayb> so now we've seen how to pass around simple messages between processes
