[08:08:50] <pratyushgr> hello
[08:12:38] <vinayb> hey pratyushgr 
[08:13:45] <pratyushgr> actually i am not clear about "what is functional concepts"
[08:14:16] <pratyushgr> the other day i got disconnected while it was being discussed
[08:16:02] <vinayb> sorry, had a technical glitch. what doubt do you have?
[08:16:22] <salman_> functional concepts
[08:16:36] <vinayb> ya what in that?
[08:16:48] <salman_> definition
[08:16:56] <salman_> what it is..
[08:17:25] <pratyushgr> yaa..what it is..
[08:19:12] <vinayb> functional concepts relate to pure functions, which don't have any side effects, now side effects can mean touching on something other than the function. pure function returns always the same value for a given parameter. however you can't make a useful program using only pure functions. You need IO. So functional languages allow you to explicitly seperate the pure functions from the impure, and functio
[08:19:18] <vinayb> nal programming is all about composing these functions together, like f o g, g o f etc/
[08:23:19] <vinayb> any doubts?
[08:23:49] <pratyushgr> yaa got it..
[08:24:21] <pratyushgr> can u give an example of pure function
[08:25:19] <vinayb> f(x) = x + 5
[08:25:50] <vinayb> whatever be value of x, for that x it will always give same value
[08:26:36] <pratyushgr> ohk
[08:26:44] <vinayb> todays_date() however is a function that always gives different values depending on which day it is
[08:27:43] <vinayb> and you can get the logs from the link on the topic :)
[08:29:01] <pratyushgr> yeah.
[08:29:11] <pratyushgr> Thankx
[08:31:39] <salman_> I had a doubt in installing Erlang on Linux
[08:32:03] <salman_> All I did was sudo apt-get install erlang
[08:32:16] <salman_> And then all those folders started downloading
[08:32:29] <salman_> Was there anything else to do as well?
[08:33:34] <vinayb> Does the erlang shell open when you type erl on the command line?
[08:34:04] *** vinayb changes topic to 'Distributed Systems Programming with Erlang | Today's log: https://goo.gl/aRNIyA'
[08:37:41] <salman_> Oh okay it does
[08:37:55] <salman_> I'm assuming that's it right?
[08:38:08] <vinayb> ya then everything is right
[08:39:59] <salman_> Cool
