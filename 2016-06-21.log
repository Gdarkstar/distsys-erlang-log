[11:37:12] <vinayb> Alright, we'll start now
[11:37:33] <vinayb> So today we are going to be starting off with concurrency in detail in Erlang
[11:37:52] <vinayb> We have covered the functional aspects and you know to play around with it
[11:38:02] <vinayb> Now we'll see the concurrent aspects
[11:38:30] <vinayb> and we'll also go over a bit of history of Erlang, to see why the things are implemented or designed the way they are
[11:38:46] <vinayb> by the way, before we proceed, any doubts from ANY of the previous sessions?
[11:39:05] <vilas_m> No
[11:39:09] <aditya> no

[11:40:37] <vinayb> Okay, so our discipline -- Programming -- or Computer Science, for that matter, has always wondered how to go about running things at the same time in a program
[11:41:17] <vinayb> The most widely used approach is either shared memory based or message passing based. Does anyone here have an idea of what shared memory approach might be?
[11:41:33] <vilas_m> Nope.
[11:42:04] <vinayb> okay, so the shared memory approach is one where we define a small region of code as a "critical section"

[11:42:40] <vinayb> that region of code is code that accesses memory that is SHARED between various different threads / processes
