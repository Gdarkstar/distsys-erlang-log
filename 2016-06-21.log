[11:37:12] <vinayb> Alright, we'll start now
[11:37:33] <vinayb> So today we are going to be starting off with concurrency in detail in Erlang
[11:37:52] <vinayb> We have covered the functional aspects and you know to play around with it
[11:38:02] <vinayb> Now we'll see the concurrent aspects
[11:38:30] <vinayb> and we'll also go over a bit of history of Erlang, to see why the things are implemented or designed the way they are
