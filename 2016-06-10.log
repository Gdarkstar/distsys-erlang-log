[11:46:46] <akshayrevankar> hello guys
[11:46:54] <vilas_m> Hi :)
[11:46:58] <rakshith> Hi!
[11:47:12] <aditya> hi!
[11:47:42] <akshayrevankar> has anyone among you learnt the quick sort algorithm for sorting?
[11:48:50] <m_gautham> better to say no
[11:48:54] <vilas_m> Had read it long back. Kinda forgot now :P. Remember something about using a pivot
[11:48:56] <akshayrevankar> lol
[11:49:35] <aditya> A little bit!
[11:50:27] <akshayrevankar> ok fine.. anyway i will prefer teaching about quick sort and how to approach it using recursion in erlang on my next session which will be the end of recursion. It will mostly not be a irc chat.. :D
[11:50:41] <akshayrevankar> difficult to teach that on just text..
[11:50:58] <akshayrevankar> so today.. we will be doing basic exception handling.
[11:51:05] <rakshith> cool!
[11:52:50] <akshayrevankar> if i am not wrong, Vilas asked me about the BIF sort.
[11:53:33] <akshayrevankar> he said he will try defining his own sorting function for the assignment 2 where is needed to use it..
[11:53:53] <vilas_m> Yea :P
[11:54:14] <vilas_m> Then you said it's better to use the inbuilt function..
[11:54:28] <akshayrevankar> I would prefer to use the BIF lists:sort rather than writing my own, because it is more optimised and erlang doesnt follow just one algorithm to sort.. it uses the best algorithm to sort..
[11:54:52] <akshayrevankar> atleast thats what the programmers think :P
[11:55:42] <akshayrevankar> so if you have a BIF, do prefer it.. but nonetheless , you should know basics of different algorithms.. so we will be discussing quick sort using recursion..
[11:56:01] <akshayrevankar> i wnt u guys to try it out before next recursion session.. without googling :P
[11:56:14] *** Quits: salman_ (b63a2e08@gateway/web/freenode/ip.182.58.46.8) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[11:56:16] <akshayrevankar> so we will start with Errors and Exceptions..
[11:56:43] <akshayrevankar> i would like all of you to open your erlang console
[11:58:25] <akshayrevankar> so firstly can anyone just tell an erlang statement to sort a list [1,2,3,4].
[11:58:30] <m_gautham> done
[11:59:17] <vilas_m> lists:sort(L).
[11:59:32] <akshayrevankar> ya correct...
[11:59:45] <akshayrevankar> now what happens if my L is '1234' ?
[12:00:09] <akshayrevankar> or say '4572' (we are using the sort function :P )
[12:00:32] <vilas_m> Pattern matching error?
[12:00:46] <akshayrevankar> ya.. its an error
[12:00:58] <akshayrevankar> because these are defined to operate on a list.
[12:01:40] <akshayrevankar> so assume you have a code snippet running and you pass '4572'.. it would be an error..
[12:02:05] <akshayrevankar> an error here is equivalent to telling.. i cant handle it.. you stop doing everything else..
[12:02:33] <akshayrevankar> so this is a function-clause error
[12:02:51] <akshayrevankar> where your function parameters couldnt match any clause
[12:03:16] <akshayrevankar> we will be discussing runtime errors for a while.. may be boring.. deal with it :P
[12:03:29] <akshayrevankar> ok now lets say a case statement
[12:04:03] <akshayrevankar> case "some random thingy" of
[12:04:10] <akshayrevankar> expected_value -> ok;
[12:04:18] <akshayrevankar>  other_expected_value -> 'still ok'
[12:04:24] <akshayrevankar> end.
[12:04:29] <akshayrevankar> what would this result in
[12:06:35] <aditya> error! No true statement
[12:07:02] <akshayrevankar> ok is that the exact line you get in erlang?
[12:08:18] <aditya> ** exception error: no case clause matching "some random"
[12:08:41] <akshayrevankar> ohk cool..
